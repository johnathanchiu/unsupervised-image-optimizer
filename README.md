# Image Optimization Using Deep Learning

Repo is still in progress... Intending to make this repo more usable for those interested! :)

## Background
This repo is an ongoing personal research project, feel free to contact me if you would like to contribute as well!  
Paper describes the basis of the work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07207.

## Usage
**At the moment: For 3-channel (rgb) color images only!!!**  
Run main.py [-i, image input path] [-o, image output folder path]
